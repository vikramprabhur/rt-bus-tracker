# Real Time Bus Tracker

## Description:
  - This page tracks, in real time, the buses currently en route on Massachusetts Bus Route 1.
  - The Red Markers track the buses Outbound from Harvard Square.
  - The Blue Markers track the buses Inbound to Nubian Station.
  - The page obtains live data, every twenty seconds, from MBTA.
  - The obtained data is then displayed, and updated, on a google map at the center of the page. 

## Launch Page:

  - [(https://vikramprabhur.github.io/rt-bus-tracker/Index.html)]

## Future Improvements:
  - My next iteration would include a version where the user could search for any desired bus route in Massachusetts to track live bus data.
  - An improvement on that would include a version where the user could search for a bus route in any desired state in the United States to track live bus data.
